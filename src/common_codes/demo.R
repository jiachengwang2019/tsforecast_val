# 1. Perform 3 hypothesis testing on interested predictor variable, in this example, the interested variable is 'SC3_Impressions'
# 2. Give a suggestion differencing_order to remove the trend in the interested variable
# 3. Provide the time series plot for interested variable
#
# Remark:
# In the test_results, KPSS is a more conservative testing strategy compared to the other two tests, ADF and PP.
# For detailed introduction to stationary test, please refer to the following wiki page:

# KPSS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPSS_test
